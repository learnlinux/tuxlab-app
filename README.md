# TuxLab
Platform for creating Interactive Linux Courses

## Installation
TuxLab is heavily dependent on the infrastructure setup.  To simplify the process of setup, we have created a [Ansible playbook](https://github.com/learnlinux/tuxlab-infra) to automatically configure the TuxLab infrastructure.

## Contributing
TuxLab is under active development. If you wish to contribute, discuss on our Gitter page:
